14;Debris shield for upper tie plate in a nuclear fuel bundle and method for filtering debris;"A nuclear reactor fuel assembly including: an upper tie plate having apertures to receive and support fuel rods of a fuel bundle; the fuel bundle includes an array of the fuel rods mounted and housed in the walls of a channel, and a load bearing or non-load bearing debris shield may be mounted in the upper tie plate, wherein the debris shield is porous to prevent the passage of debris. The debris shield is mounted in the frame of the upper tie plate. The debris shield can be either a removable unit, or it can be attached as a permanent integrated structure within the upper tie plate. The upper tie plate frame is also porous, e.g., has small vertical openings to allow fluid to pass through the frame and block passage of debris. The openings in the frame increase the effective flow area of passages through the upper tie plate and thereby compensate or offset any flow restrictions due to the debris shield. Preventing debris falling into the fuel bundle is expected to assure the operational life of the fuel assembly by reducing the risk of fuel rod failure and premature discharge from the reactor core.";"DE FILIPPIS MICHAEL S [US]

Radius coining allows the fuel rod to smoothly transition over the radiused edge to the flat rod contact section of the dimple. The symmetric ""dog bone"" shape enables the dimple to pivot during rod loading resulting in improved alignment between the dimple and the fuel rod, thereby minimizing scratching. The ""dog bone"" shape also allows for a large contact area dimple to be softer than a typical dimple which reduces contact stresses and fretting wear during reactor operations";"BOONE MICHAEL L [US]

77;NUCLEAR REACTOR FUEL ASSEMBLY;The invention is related to the nuclear power industry sphere, specifically to the design of fuel assemblies of nuclear reactors, and is aimed at supporting efficient mixing of the heat carrier.The nuclear reactor fuel assembly with the cross-section in the form of equilateral hexagon contains upper and lower end caps, guide channels, fuel elements situated in triangular network points, and at least one array consisting of cells integrally connected in between, made in polyhedral tube form, whose longitudinal axis coincides with the longitudinal axis of the fuel element. Six non-adjacent edges of the cell are made inclined on account of changing the edge width along the cell axis. Edges parallel to the fuel assembly axis, with cells adjacent to each other thereby, are located between inclined edges. Cells in this case are situated in the array in rows parallel to one of main diagonals of the regular hexagon. One pair of opposite inclined edges has edge width from the upper end cap side smaller than edge width from the lower end cap side. The cell centerline crossing these edges makes an angle of 30 degrees with the aforementioned diagonal. Remaining inclined edges has edge width from the upper end cap side greater than edge width from the lower end cap side. Cells of each row have similar orientation and centerlines of cells in adjacent rows form an angle of 60 degrees.The width of inclined cell edges is changing along the cell axis in a way that the cell cross-section area is constant along its axis.The invention makes it possible to reduce irregularity of heat carrier parameters in the fuel assembly and increase the reactor capacity on account of increasing margins to critical parameters of heat carrier.;"ENIN ANATOLY ALEKSEEVICH [RU]

The pool includes fuel racks containing spent fuel assemblies which heat the water via radioactive decay. A dual liner system enclosing the pool forms an impervious barrier providing redundant provisions for preventing leakage of contaminated pool water into the environment. An interstitial space is formed between the liners which may be maintained at sub-atmospheric pressures by a vacuum pump system that evacuates the space. By maintaining the pressure in the space at a negative pressure with corresponding boiling point less than the temperature of the pool water, any leakage through the inner-most liner into the interstitial space will vaporize and be extracted via the pump for signaling a potential leak in the liner system.;SINGH KRISHNA P [US];HOLTEC INTERNATIONAL [US];"EP3204949A1

88;Method for improving energy output of a nuclear reactor, method for determining natural uranium blanket for a fuel bundle, and a fuel bundle having a variable blanket layer;A method for improving the energy generating output of a nuclear reactor containing one or more fuel rods (100) in one or more fuel rod bundles (116) while satisfying a maximum subcritical banked withdrawal position (MSBWP) reactivity limit, enrichments of individual fuel rods in an axial cross-section of a lattice being evaluated at the top of the fuel bundle are ranked, and the fuel pins of the highest ranked rod location in the lattice are replaced with natural uranium pins. A core simulation is then performed to determine whether there is any margin to a MSBWP reactivity limit. For each lower ranked candidate rod position, the pin replacing and core simulation functions are repeated until no rod location violates the MSBWP reactivity limit, so as to achieve a desired lattice design for the top of the fuel bundle (116).;"KROPACZEK DAVID JOSEPH [US]

148;DEBRIS FILTERS FOR NUCLEAR FUEL ASSEMBLY AND METHOD OF USING THE SAME;Debris filters fit in fuel assembly lower tie plates and filter fluids passing therethrough. Filters use a series of adjacent plates with aligned peaks and valleys to create several channels. The plates have small excisions in diamond, triangle, or other debris-catching shapes, such as near a lower portion of the filter where fluid enters the filter. Excisions may alternate around each channel, such as four alternating cut-outs in 90-degree intervals about a channel circumference. Excisions may be sized to entrap smaller debris common in reactor coolant flow and liable for fretting damage to fuel cladding. Multiple vertical stages can be used in filters, with different channels for each stage. Ligaments may hold each stage to the next, potentially with a gap between stages for intermixing. Plates, peaks, valleys, ligaments, and excisions may all be formed in a single stamping operation to eliminate excess or overlapping pieces or extensions.;"SMITH BRANDON P [US]

The leak location is calculated by triangulating the radiation readings from a fixed linear array of detectors positioned adjacent to the channel s to determine the location of the strongest radiation reading and the location along the length of the channel where the increase in radiation occurred.;"HEIBEL MICHAEL D [US]

260;Apparatus and method for welding strap connections between inner grid straps of spacer grid using laser tool, and spacer grid manufactured using the same;Disclosed are an apparatus and method for welding strap connections between inner grid straps of a spacer grid using a laser tool, and a spacer grid manufactured by the same, in which the strap connections between the inner grid straps of the spacer grid are seam-welded continuously or intermittently using the laser tool, so that the structural strength of the spacer grid is increased, a spattering phenomenon, in which a welded material is spattered during welding, is reduced, and thermal deformation is reduced. Further, fine welding is possible, and thus the welded bead of each strap connection between the inner grid straps can have a small size, and the number of welding defects can be reduced. In addition, the flow resistance of a coolant is reduced, and thereby the pressure drop of the coolant can be reduced. As a result, the load on a flow pump for the coolant can be reduced, and economic efficiency and safety can be improved.;"SONG KEE NAM [KR]
